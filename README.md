# Arduino LED Blinking with Serial Communication

## Description
This is my first Arduino project. It blinks an LED connected to pin 8 and sends "Hello, World!" over the serial port every second.

## Hardware Requirements
- Arduino board
- LED and 220Î© resistor
- 2 Jumper wires
- Breadboard

## How to Use
1. Connect the LED and resistor in series between pin 8 and ground.
2. Upload the code to your Arduino board.
3. Open the Serial Monitor at 9600 baud to see the "Hello, World!" message.
